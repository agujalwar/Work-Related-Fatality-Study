# Work-Related-Fatality-Study
* Conducted a comprehensive analysis of Work-Related Fatality Study data to scrutinize fatal incidents across diverse workplaces.
* Utilized Python for meticulous data cleaning and MySQL queries for in-depth scenario analysis, demonstrating proficiency in both tools.
* Successfully addressed challenges, including calculating year-to-year percentage changes, by implementing advanced functions such as the LAG function.
* Examined factors contributing to work-related fatalities, identified trends, and patterns, providing key insights to enhance workplace safety measures.
* Translated complex data into actionable insights through the creation of a compelling Power BI report for effective data visualization.

### Columns: 

1. ID: This column represents a unique identifier assigned to each incident. It helps in distinguishing and referencing specific incidents in the dataset. 

2. Incident Date: This column records the date when the fatal incident occurred. It provides a chronological timeline for analyzing the incidents over a specific period. 

3. Day of the Week: This column captures the day of the week corresponding to the incident date. It helps in examining whether certain days of the week have a higher frequency of work-related fatalities. 

4. City: This column contains the name of the city where the incident took place. It provides geographical information about the location of the incident. 

5. State: This column records the state where the incident occurred. It helps in analyzing work-related fatalities based on different states and identifying regional trends. 

6. Description: This column provides a detailed description of the incident, including the circumstances, causes, and contributing factors. It helps in understanding the nature of the incidents and identifying common themes or risks. 

7. Plan: This column indicates any existing safety plans or protocols that were in place at the workplace. It helps in evaluating the effectiveness of safety measures and identifying areas for improvement. 

8. Citation: This column captures information about any citations issued by regulatory authorities, such as OSHA, in relation to the incident. It indicates whether violations of safety regulations were identified and recorded. 

9. Unnamed: This column contains 0 for all the rows. And it is not required for the analysis. 

## Project Description:  

This project focuses on training on how to use SQL to analyze a real-world database, how to extract the most useful information from the dataset, how to pre-process the data using Python for improved performance, and how to use a structured query language to retrieve useful information from the database. 

Module 1: Cleaning the dataset 

Module 2: Run SQL queries
